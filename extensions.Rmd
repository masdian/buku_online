## Additional Grouping Structure

### Cross-classified models

Oftentimes there will be additional sources of variance beyond one
grouping factor. Consider as an example, a visual perception experiment
where there are multiple trials for each individual, along with specific
images displayed. Such data might look like this.

```{r demodata_crossed, echo=FALSE}
crossing(Person = 1:20, Image = letters[1:10]) %>%
  mutate(score = sample(1:10, 200, replace = T)) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    options = list(
      dom = 'tp',
      autoWidth = F,
      columnDefs = list(
        list(width = '10px', targets = 0:2),
        list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 0:2)
      )
    ),
    rownames = F,
    width = 250
  )
```

<br> <br>

In these situations, we have observations clustered within both person
and image, but person and image are not nested within one another- all
participants see all 10 images. Such a situation is typically referred
to as one in which there are [crossed]{.emph} random effects, which just
means non-nested. In the situations we'll look at next, we will have
multiple sources variances to consider.

#### Example: Student achievement

For our own demonstration we'll look at achievement scores for students.
The sources of dependency are due to students having gone to the same
primary or secondary schools. However, in this example, going to a
primary school doesn't necessarily mean you'll go to a specific
secondary school. Note also that there are no repeated measures, we see
each student only once. Here's a quick look a the data, and for more
detail, check the [appendix][Data].

```{r pupil_nurses_setup, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
pupils = read_sav('data/raw_data/joop_hox_data2/9 CrossClass/pupcross.sav') %>%
  as_factor() %>%
  mutate(ACHIEV = as.numeric(as.character(ACHIEV)),
         PUPSEX = factor(PUPSEX, labels = c('male', 'female'))) %>%
  rename(
    achievement = ACHIEV,
    primary_school_id = PSCHOOL,
    secondary_school_id = SSCHOOL,
    sex = PUPSEX,
    ses = PUPSES,
    primary_denominational = PDENOM,
    secondary_denominational = SDENOM
  )  

save(pupils, file='data/pupils.RData')

nurses = read_sav('data/raw_data/joop_hox_data2/2 Basic Model/nurses.sav') %>%
  as_factor() %>%
  rename(experience = experien,
         treatment = expcon,
         sex = gender) %>%
  mutate(
    treatment = factor(treatment, labels = c('Ctrl', 'Training')),
    age = as.numeric(as.character(age)),
    sex = factor(sex, labels = c('Male', 'Female'))
  ) %>%
  select(-starts_with('Z'),-starts_with('C'))

save(nurses, file = 'data/nurses.RData')
```

```{r examine_pupil_data, echo=1}
load('data/pupils.RData')

DT::datatable(pupils,
              options = list(
                dom = 'tp',
                scrollX = T,
                autoWidth = T
              ),
              # columnDefs = list(list(width = '150px', targets = 1),
              #                   list(width = '100px', targets = 3))),
              rownames = F)
```

<br> <br>

For our mixed model we'll look at the effects for `sex` and
socioeconomic status, `ses`, a six level variable from low to high, on
scholastic achievement. The range of achievement scores is roughly
`r round(min(pupils$achievement))` to
`r round(max(pupils$achievement))`, with mean of
`r round(mean(pupils$achievement), 1)` and standard deviation
`r round(sd(pupils$achievement), 1)`. We'll take into account the
clustering at primary school and secondary school. To incorporate the
additional structure in [lme4]{.pack} syntax is very easy, we just do as
we did before, though now for both grouping factors[^extensions-1].

[^extensions-1]: I don't show the formal model here as we did before,
    but this is why depicting mixed models solely as 'multilevel'
    becomes a bit problematic in my opinion. In the standard mixed model
    notation it's straightforward though, you just add an additional
    random effect term, just as we do in the actual model syntax.

```{r cross_classified, eval=1}
pupils_crossed = lmer(
  achievement ~ sex + ses 
  + (1|primary_school_id) + (1|secondary_school_id),
  data = pupils
)

summary(pupils_crossed, correlation = FALSE)
```

```{r cross_classified_fixed, echo=FALSE}
pupils_crossed %>% 
  extract_fixed_effects() %>% 
  select(-(t:p_value)) %>% 
  kable_df()
```

The fixed effects tell us there is a positive effect of being female on
achievement, and in general, relative to lowest SES category, being in
the upper categories of SES also has a positive effect.

```{r  cross_classified_random, echo=FALSE}
crossed_var_cor = extract_vc(pupils_crossed, ci_level = 0) 

crossed_var_cor %>%
  kable_df(digits = 2)
```

When we look at the variance components we see that primary and
secondary school contributes about
`r perc(sum(crossed_var_cor$variance[1:2])/sum(crossed_var_cor$variance), digits = 0)`
of the total variance. Most of the variance attributable to school comes
from the primary school.

If we inspect the random effects, we can see that we now have two sets
of effects- `r n_distinct(pupils$primary_school_id)` for the primary
schools, and `r n_distinct(pupils$secondary_school_id)` for the
secondary. Both would be incorporated into any pupil-specific
prediction.

```{r crossed_re}
glimpse(ranef(pupils_crossed))
```

Let's look at them visually using [merTools]{.pack}.

```{r crossed_re_plot, echo=FALSE}
p = merTools::plotREsim(merTools::REsim(pupils_crossed)) +
  theme_clean()
p

# multiplots with patchwork still do non-transparent background
# library(patchwork)
# p1 = plot_coefficients(pupils_crossed, ranef=T, which_ranef='primary_school_id') +
#   labs(x='Primary School') +
#   lims(y = c(-1.5,1.5)) +
#   theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
#         axis.text.x = element_blank())
# p2 = plot_coefficients(pupils_crossed, ranef=T, which_ranef='secondary_school_id') +
#   labs(x='Secondary School', y='') +
#   lims(y = c(-1.5,1.5)) +
#   theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),
#         axis.text.x = element_blank(),
#         axis.text.y = element_blank())
# {p1 + p2} 
```

Note that we have the usual extensions here if desired. As an example,
we could also do random slopes for student level characteristics.

### Hierarchical structure

Now that we have looked at cross-classified models, we can proceed to
examine hierarchical cluster structuring. In this situation we have
clusters nested within other clusters, which may be nested within still
other clusters. A typical example might be cities within counties, and
counties within states.

#### Example: Nurses and stress

For our demonstration we'll use the nurses data set. Here we are
interested in the effect of a training program (`treatment`) on stress
levels (on a scale of 1-7) of nurses. In this scenario, nurses are
nested within wards, which themselves are nested within hospitals, so we
will have random effects pertaining to ward (within hospital) and
hospital. For more information see the [appendix][Data].

```{r nurses_data, echo=1}
load('data/nurses.RData')

DT::datatable(nurses,
              options = list(
                dom = 'tp',
                scrollX = T,
                autoWidth = T
              ),
              # columnDefs = list(list(width = '150px', targets = 1),
              #                   list(width = '100px', targets = 3))),
              rownames = F)
```

<br> <br>

For the model we examine effects of the treatment as well as several
other covariates, at least one at each of the nurse, ward, and hospital
levels. Again, when it comes to the fixed effects portion, you can
simply think about that part as you would any standard regression, we
just add covariates as theory/exploration would suggest. To incorporate
this type of random effects structure is not too different from the
cross-classified approach, but does have a slight change to the syntax.

```{r hierarchical, eval=1}
nurses_hierarchical = lmer(
  stress ~ age + sex + experience + treatment + wardtype + hospsize
  + (1 | hospital) + (1 | hospital:ward),
  data = nurses
)

# same thing!
nurses_hierarchical = lmer(
  stress ~ age  + sex + experience + treatment + wardtype + hospsize 
  + (1|hospital/ward), 
  data = nurses
) 

summary(nurses_hierarchical, correlation = F)
```

```{r hierarchical_fixed, echo=FALSE}
nurses_hierarchical %>% 
  extract_fixed_effects() %>% 
  select(-(t:p_value)) %>% 
  kable_df()
```

<br>

As far as the fixed effects go, about the only thing that doesn't have a
statistical effect is ward type[^extensions-2].

[^extensions-2]: Setting aside our discussion to take a turn regarding
    regression modeling more generally, this is a good example of
    'surprising' effects not being so surprising when you consider them
    more closely. Take a look at the effect of experience. More
    experience means less stress, this is probably not surprising. Now
    look at the age effect. It's positive! But wouldn't older nurses
    have more experience? What's going on here? When interpreting
    experience, it is with age *held constant*, thus more experience
    helps with lowering stress no matter what your age. With age, we're
    holding experience constant. If experience doesn't matter, being
    older is affiliated with more stress, which might be expected given
    the type of very busy and high pressure work often being done (the
    mean age is `r median(nurses$age)`). A good way to better understand
    this specifically is to look at predicted values when age is young,
    middle, and older vs. experience levels at low, middle, and high
    experience, possibly explicitly including the interaction of the two
    in the model. Also note that if you take experience out of the
    model, the age effect is negative, which is expected, as it captures
    experience also.

<br>

```{r hierarchical_random, echo=FALSE}
# note tidy doesn't work with multiple random effects and conf.int
hierarch_var_cor = extract_vc(nurses_hierarchical, ci_level = 0)

hierarch_var_cor %>%
  kable_df()
```

Concerning the random effects, there appears to be quite a bit of
variability from ward to ward especially, but also hospital. Recall that
stress is a 7 point scale, so from ward to ward we can expect scores to
bounce around about half a point on average, which is quite dramatic in
my opinion. Again we inspect it visually.

```{r hierarchical_re_plot, echo=FALSE}
p = merTools::plotREsim(merTools::REsim(nurses_hierarchical)) +
  theme_clean()
p
```

### Crossed vs. nested

The following shows the difference in the results from treating ward as
a nested (within hospital) vs. crossed random effect. What do you notice
is different?

```{r crossed_vs_nested, echo=1:3}
nurses_hierarchical = lmer(
  stress ~ age  + sex + experience + treatment + wardtype + hospsize 
  + (1|hospital) + (1|hospital:wardid), 
  data = nurses
)

nurses_crossed = lmer(
  stress ~ age  + sex + experience + treatment + wardtype + hospsize 
  + (1|hospital) + (1|wardid),
  data = nurses
)

hierarch_var_cor %>%  
  kable_df()

crossed_var_cor = extract_vc(nurses_crossed, ci_level = 0)

crossed_var_cor %>%  
  kable_df()
```

Nothing? Good, you're not crazy. Here's a quote from the [lme4
text](http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/book/Ch2.pdf), section 2.2.1.1,
which is definitely worth your time.

You might have noticed that we were using `wardid` rather than the
`ward` grouping variable as in our first example. Even though every ward
is unique, the `ward` column labels them with an arbitrary sequence
starting with 1. While this might seem natural, ward 1 in hospital 1 is
not the same as ward 1 in hospital 2, so it's probably not a good idea
to give them the same label. The `wardid` column properly distinguishes
the wards with unique values (e.g. 11, 12).

What would have happened had we used that variable as a crossed random
effect?

```{r bad_cross, echo=1}
nurses_crossed_bad_data = lmer(
  stress ~ age  + sex + experience + treatment + wardtype + hospsize 
  + (1|hospital) + (1|ward), 
  data = nurses
)

extract_vc(nurses_crossed_bad_data, ci_level = 0) %>%
  kable_df()
```

This is certainly not the result we want. The variance in `ward` is
already captured by treatment and type. However, as demonstrated, this
can be avoided with the proper syntax, or proper labeling in the data to
allow unique clusters to have unique identifiers.

See this [discussion
also](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/228800/crossed-vs-nested-random-effects-how-do-they-differ-and-how-are-they-specified),
as well as [this from the
FAQ](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#nested-or-crossed)
from one of the [lme4]{.pack} developers. Josh Errickson at CSCAR also
has a nice [write-up with visual
depiction](http://errickson.net/stats-notes/vizrandomeffects.html) of
the underlying matrices of interest, which served as inspiration for
some of the visualization in the next section.

So there you have it. When it comes to [lme4]{.pack}, or mixed models
more generally, crossed vs. nested is simply a state of mind
(data)[^extensions-3].

[^extensions-3]: Just a reminder, it *does* matter if you label your
    data in a less than optimal fashion. For example, if in the nesting
    situation you start your id variable at 1 for each nested group,
    then you have to use the nested notation in [lme4]{.pack},
    otherwise, e.g. it won't know that id = 1 in group 1 is different
    from id 1 in group 2. In our hospital example, this would be akin to
    using `ward` instead of `wardid` as we did. Again though, this
    wouldn't be an issue if one practices good data habits. Note also
    the `:` syntax. In other modeling contexts in R this denotes an
    interaction, and that is no different here. In some contexts,
    typically due to experimental designs, one would want to explore
    random effects of the sort 1\|A, 1\|B and 1\|A:B. However, this is
    relatively rare.

## Residual Structure

Sometimes we will want to obtain more specific estimates regarding the
residual covariance/correlation structure. This is especially the case
in the longitudinal setting, where we think that observations closer in
time would be more strongly correlated than those further apart, or that
the variance changes over time. What does this model look like?

Let's begin by thinking about the covariance/correlation matrix for the
entire set of observations for our target variable, and how we want to
represent the dependency in those observations. I'll show a
visualization of the first 5 people from our GPA data and modeling
situation. Recall that each person has 6 observations. This display
regards the results from our random intercepts (only) model for GPA.

```{r residual_varcov, echo=FALSE}
rescov <- function(model, data) {
  var.d <- crossprod(getME(model,"Lambdat"))
  Zt <- getME(model,"Zt")
  vr <- sigma(model)^2
  var.b <- vr*(t(Zt) %*% var.d %*% Zt)
  sI <- vr * Diagonal(nrow(data))
  var.y <- var.b + sI
  invisible(var.y)
}
gpa_vis_cov = lmer(gpa ~ occasion + (1|student), data=gpa)
# summary(gpa_vis_cov)

rc1 <- rescov(gpa_vis_cov, gpa)
# image(rc1[1:60,1:60])
rc1[1:30, 1:30] %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  reshape2::melt() %>%
  mutate(value = factor(round(value, 5))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = 'gray92', size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'reverse') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray92', '#00aaff80', '#ff550080')) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.key = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = 'transparent', colour = NA),
    legend.background = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = 'transparent', colour = NA),
    panel.background = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    panel.grid = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    strip.background = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    plot.background = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA)
  )

  
# ggplotly()

# library(plotly)
# library(viridis)
# plot_ly(z =~ as.matrix(rc1[1:30, 1:30]), type='contour', colors = c('gray92','#00aaff80', '#ff550080')) %>%
#   layout(yaxis = list(autorange = "reversed"))
```

Each block represents the covariance matrix pertaining to observations
within an individual. Within the person there are variances on the
diagonal and covariances on the off-diagonal. When considering the whole
data, we can see that observations from one person have no covariance
with another person (gray). Furthermore, the covariance within a person
is a constant value, the variance is also a constant value. Where did
those values come from?

```{r residual_varcov2, echo=F}
vc = extract_vc(gpa_vis_cov, ci_level = 0)

totvar = sum(vc$variance)

vc %>%  
  kable_df()
```

Remember that there are two sources of variance in this model, the
residual observation level variance, and that pertaining to person.
Combined they provide the total residual variance that we aren't already
capturing with our covariates. In this case, it's about
`r round(totvar, 2)`, the value displayed on our diagonal. The
off-diagonal is the variance attributable to student, which we
alternately interpreted as an intraclass correlation (dividing by the
total variance converts it to the correlation metric).

More generically, and referring to previous notation for our estimated
variances, we can see the covariance matrix (for a cluster) as follows.

$$\Sigma = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} 
\color{orange}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} & \tau^2   & \tau^2  & \tau^2 & \tau^2 & \tau^2   \\
\tau^2   & \color{orange}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} & \tau^2 & \tau^2 & \tau^2 & \tau^2    \\
\tau^2   & \tau^2   & \color{orange}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} & \tau^2 & \tau^2 & \tau^2  \\
\tau^2   & \tau^2   & \tau^2 & \color{orange}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} & \tau^2 & \tau^2\\
\tau^2   & \tau^2   & \tau^2  & \tau^2 & \color{orange}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}  & \tau^2 \\
\tau^2   & \tau^2   & \tau^2  & \tau^2   & \tau^2  & \color{orange}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2} \\
\end{array}\right]$$ <br>

This represents a covariance structure of [compound symmetry]{.emph}. It
is the default in most mixed model settings, and the same as what is
shown visually above. Now let's start to think about other types of
covariance structures.

Consider the following model for an individual and just three time
points to keep things simpler to show.

$$\boldsymbol{y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$$

So we have three observations of $y$ that are multivariate normally
distributed. The mean $\mu$ is a function of covariates just like in
standard regression.

$$\mu = b_0 + b_1\cdot \mathrm{time} + b_2\cdot x_1 ...$$

However, instead of just plopping an $\epsilon$ at the end, we want to
go further in defining the entire residual variance/covariance structure
for all three time points.

In the simplest setting of a standard linear regression model, we have
constant variance and no covariance.

$$\Sigma = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} 
\sigma^2 & 0   & 0   \\
0   & \sigma^2 & 0   \\
0   & 0   & \sigma^2 \\
\end{array}\right]$$

Next, we can relax the assumption of equal variances, and estimate each
separately. In this case of heterogeneous variances, we might see more
or less variance over time, for example.

$$\Sigma = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} 
\sigma_1^2 & 0   & 0   \\
0   & \sigma_2^2 & 0   \\
0   & 0   & \sigma_3^2 \\
\end{array}\right]$$

Now let's say we actually want to get at the underlying
covariance/correlation. I'll switch to the correlation representation,
but you can still think of the variances as constant or separately
estimated. So now we have something like this, where $\rho$ represents
the residual correlation among observations.

$$\Sigma = \sigma^2
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} 
1 & \rho_1   & \rho_2   \\
\rho_1   & 1 & \rho_3   \\
\rho_2   & \rho_3   & 1 \\
\end{array}\right]$$

In this case we'd estimate a different correlation for all time point
pairs (with constant variance). This is typically described as an
[unstructured]{.emph}, or simply 'symmetric', correlation structure.

If you are familiar with repeated measures ANOVA, which is a [special
case of a mixed
model](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/mixedModels/anovamixed.html), you
may recall that the usual assumption is a [sphericity]{.emph}, a relaxed
form of [compound symmetry]{.emph}, where all the correlations have the
same value, i.e. $\rho_1=\rho_2=\rho_3$, and all variances are equal.

Another very commonly used correlation structure (for time-based
settings) is an [autocorrelation]{.emph} structure, of lag order one,
for the residuals. What this means is that we assume the residuals at
one time point apart correlate with some value $\rho$, observations at
two time points apart correlate $\rho^2$, and so on. As such we only
need to estimate $\rho$, while the rest are then automatically
determined. Here's what it'd look like for four time points.

$$\Sigma = \sigma^2
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc} 
1 & \rho     & \rho^2   & \rho^3   \\
\rho     & 1 & \rho     & \rho^2   \\
\rho^2   & \rho     & 1 & \rho     \\
\rho^3   & \rho^2   & \rho     & 1 \\
\end{array}\right]$$

If $\rho$ was estimated to be .5, it would look like the following.

$$\Sigma = \sigma^2
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc} 
1 & .5       & .25      & .06   \\
.5       & 1 & .5       & .25  \\
.25      & .5       & 1 & .5    \\
.06      & .25      &  .5      & 1 \\
\end{array}\right]$$

Again, the main point is that points further apart in time are assumed
to have less correlation.

Know that there are many patterns and possibilities to potentially
consider, and that they are not limited to the repeated measures
scenario. For example, the correlation could represent spatial
structure, where units closer together geographically would be more
correlated. And as noted, we could also have variances that are
different at each time point[^extensions-4]. We'll start with that for
the next example.

[^extensions-4]: One reason to do so would be that you expect
    variability to decrease over time, e.g. due to experience. You might
    also allow that variance to be different due to some other grouping
    factor entirely (e.g. due to treatment group membership).

### Heterogeneous variance

Unfortunately, [lme4]{.pack} does not provide the ability to model the
residual covariance structure, at least [not in a straightforward
fashion](https://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/notes/corr_braindump.html),
though many other mixed model packages do[^extensions-5]. In fact, two
packages that come with the basic R installation do so, [mgcv]{.pack}
and [nlme]{.pack}. We'll demonstrate with the latter.

[^extensions-5]: This feature request has been made by its users for
    over a decade at this point- it's not gonna happen. The issue is
    that the way [lmer]{.pack} works by default employs a method that
    won't allow it (this is why it is faster and better performing than
    other packages). Unfortunately the common response to this issue is
    'use [nlme]{.pack}'. However many other packages work with
    [lme4]{.pack} rather than [nlme]{.pack}, and if you aren't going to
    use [lme4]{.pack} for mixed models you might as well go Bayesian
    with [rstanarm]{.pack} or [brms]{.pack} instead of [nlme]{.pack}. I
    would even prefer [mgcv]{.pack} to [nlme]{.pack} (though it can use
    [nlme]{.pack} under the hood) because of the other capabilities it
    provides, and the objects created are easier to work with in my
    opinion.

The [nlme]{.pack} package will have a different random effect
specification, though not *too* different. In addition, to estimate
heterogeneous variances, we'll need to use an additional `weights`
argument. The following will allow each time point of occasion to have a
unique estimate.

```{r heterovar, echo=1:5, eval=-5}
library(nlme)

heterovar_res = lme(
  gpa ~ occasion,
  data = gpa,
  random = ~ 1 | student,
  weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | occasion)
)

summary(heterovar_res)

extract_fixed_effects(heterovar_res) %>% 
  kable_df()

vc = extract_vc(heterovar_res, ci_level = 0)
vc %>% 
  kable_df()
```

At this point we're getting the same stuff we're used to. Now the not-so
fun part. For the values we're interested in for this example, i.e. the
variances at each occasion, [nlme]{.pack} does not make it easy on
someone to understand initially, as the output regards the way things
are for estimation, not for what one would usually have to report. The
variances are scaled relative to the first variance estimate, which is
actually the reported residual variance in the random effects part.
Additionally the values are also on the standard deviation rather than
variance scale. From the default output display, we can see that
variance decreases over time in this case, but the actual values are not
provided.

```{r heterovar_variances}
summary(heterovar_res$modelStruct)
```

Relative values are fine, I guess, but what we'd want are the actual
estimates. Here's how you can get them using the residual standard
deviation to scale those values, then square them to get on the variance
scale.

```{r heterovar_extract_vars_from_nlmes_cold_dead_hands}
(c(1.0000000, coef(heterovar_res$modelStruct$varStruct, unconstrained=F))*heterovar_res$sigma)^2
```

Yeah. You'll have to look this up every time you want to do it, or just
make your own function that takes the model input. Here is how my
function would extract the information.

```{r mixedup-extract_het_var}
mixedup::extract_het_var(heterovar_res, scale = 'var')
```

A newer alternative to keep in mind is [glmmTMB]{.pack}. It would allow
one to stay more in the [lme4]{.pack} style and output.

```{r glmmTMB_hetero}
library(glmmTMB)

heterovar_res2 = glmmTMB(
  gpa ~ occasion + (1|student) + diag(0 + occas |student), 
  data = gpa
)

summary(heterovar_res2)
```

Note that the variances displayed for each time point are not conflated
with the residual variance. To compare with [nlme]{.pack}, just add the
residual variance to those estimates. As with every mixed model package
(apparently), it still takes a bit to get the variances in a usable form
from the [VarCorr]{.func} object. The following shows how though, and
compares to the [nlme]{.pack} result.

```{r extract-het-var-glmmtmb, eval = FALSE}
vc_glmmtmb = VarCorr(heterovar_res2)
vc_glmmtmb = attr(vc_glmmtmb$cond$student.1, 'stddev')^2 + sigma(heterovar_res2)^2
```

Here is the output from my function:

```{r mixedup-extract_het_var-tmb}
mixedup::extract_het_var(heterovar_res2, scale = 'var')
```

In any case, putting these together shows we get the same result.

```{r glmmTMB_hetero_compare_nlme, echo=F}
vc_glmmtmb = extract_het_var(heterovar_res2, scale = 'var')[-1] # remove group id
vc_nlme = extract_het_var(heterovar_res, scale = 'var')

names(vc_glmmtmb) = names(vc_nlme) = 
  unite(expand_grid(paste('year', 1:3), paste('sem', 1:2)), 'x', everything(), sep = ' ')$x

vc_compare = rbind(glmmTMB = vc_glmmtmb, nlme = vc_nlme) 

vc_compare %>% 
  kable_df()
```

### Autocorrelation

The following example shows the same basic model, but with the
autocorrelation structure we described previously. In [nlme]{.pack} we
use the built-in [corAR1]{.func} function and `correlation` argument
similar to how we did with the weights argument.

```{r corr_residual, echo=1:5, eval=-5}
library(nlme)

corr_res = lme(
  gpa ~ occasion,
  data = gpa,
  random = ~ 1 | student,
  correlation = corAR1(form = ~ occasion)
)

summary(corr_res)

extract_fixed_effects(corr_res) %>% 
  kable_df()

vc = extract_vc(corr_res, ci_level = 0)
vc %>% 
  kable_df()
```

<br>

Notice first that the fixed effect for occasion is the same as
[before][Mixed model]. The variance estimates have changed slightly
along with the variances of the fixed effects (i.e. the standard
errors). The main thing is that we have a new parameter called `Phi` in
the [nlme]{.pack} output that represents our autocorrelation, `Phi`,
with value of
`r round(coef(corr_res$model$corStruct, unconstrained = F), 3)`. This
suggests at least some correlation exists among the residuals for
observations next to each other in time, though it diminishes quickly as
observations grow further apart.

Note that glmmTMB will analyze such structure as well. Note that we need
the factor form for occasion for this specification, and also note how
it is part of model formula, like another random effect. More on this in
the [supplemental section][Correlation Structure Revisited].

```{r corr_residual_glmmTMB, eval=FALSE, echo=1:4}
corr_res_tmb = glmmTMB(
  gpa ~ occasion +  ar1(0 + occas | student) + (1 | student),

)

  gpa ~ occasion +  ar(occasion, student) + (1 | student),
  data = gpa,
  cores = 4
)

```

## Generalized Linear Mixed Models

Just as generalized linear models extend the standard linear model, we
can generalize (linear) mixed models to [generalized linear mixed
models]{.emph}. Furthermore, there is nothing restricting us to only the
exponential family, as other packages would potentially allow for many
other response distributions.

For this example we'll do a logistic regression in the mixed model
setting. In this case, we'll use the speed dating data set. In the speed
dating events, the experiment randomly assigned each participant to ten
short dates (four minutes) with other participants. For each date, each
person rated six attributes (attractive, sincere, intelligent, fun,
ambitious, shared interests) of the other person on a 10-point scale and
wrote down whether he or she would like to see the other person again.

Our target variable is whether the participant would be willing to date
the person again (`decision`). To keep things simple, the predictors
will be limited to the sex of the participant (`sex`), whether the
partner was of the same race (`samerace`), and three of the attribute
ratings the participant gave of their partner- attractiveness
(`attractive`), sincerity (`sincere`), and intelligence (`intelligent`).
The latter have been scaled to have zero mean and standard deviation of
.5, which puts them on a more even footing with the binary covariates
(`_sc`)[^extensions-6].

[^extensions-6]: Note that for a balanced binary variable, the mean
    `p=.5` and standard deviation is `sqrt(p*(1-p)) = .5`

```{r speed_dating, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
speed_dating0 = readr::read_csv('data/raw_data/ARM_Data/Speed Dating Data.csv')

```

```{r glmm_fixed, echo=FALSE}
load('data/speed_dating_model.RData')

extract_fixed_effects(sd_model) %>% 
  kable_df()
```

<br>

The fixed effects results are as expected for the attributes, with
attractiveness being a very strong effect in particular. In addition,
having a partner of the same race had a positive effect, while sex of
the participant was statistically negligible. You are free to
exponentiate the coefficients to get the odds ratios if desired, just as
you would with standard logistic regression.

<br>

```{r glmm_random, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
extract_vc(sd_model, ci_level = 0) %>% 
  select(-var_prop) %>% 
  kable_df()
```

<br>

For the variance components, notice that there is no residual variance.
This is because we are not modeling with the normal distribution for the
response, thus there is no $\sigma$ to estimate. However, the result
suggests that there is quite a bit of variability from person to person.

## Exercises for Extensions

### Sociometric data

In the following data, kids are put into different groups and rate each
other in terms of how much they would like to share some activity with
the others. We have identifying variables for the person doing the
rating (sender), the person being rated (receiver), what group they are
in, as well as age and sex for both sender and receiver, as well as
group size.

```{r socio_setup, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
soc = read_spss('data/raw_data/joop_hox_data2/9 CrossClass/SocsLong.sav')
glimpse(soc)


sociometric = soc %>% 
  mutate(sexsend = factor(sexsend, labels = c('Male', 'Female')),  # from text 0 male, 1 female
         sexrec = factor(sexrec, labels = c('Male', 'Female')))

save(sociometric, file='data/sociometric.RData')
```

To run a mixed model, we will have three sources of structure to
consider:

-   senders (within group)
-   receivers (within group)
-   group

First, load the sociometric data.

```{r load_socio}
load('data/sociometric.RData')
```

To run the model, we will proceed with the following modeling steps. For
each, make sure you are creating a separate model object for each model
run.

-   Model 1: No covariates, only sender and receiver random effects.
    Note that even though we don't add group yet, still use the nesting
    approach to specify the effects (e.g. `1|group:receiver`)
-   Model 2: No covariates, add group random effect
-   Model 3: Add all covariates: `agesend/rec`, `sexsend/rec`, and
    `grsize` (group size)
-   Model 4: In order to examine sex matching effects, add an
    interaction of the sex variables to the model `sexsend:sexrec`.
-   Compare models with AIC (see the note about [model comparison][model
    comparison]), e.g. `AIC(model1)`. A lower value would indicate the
    model is preferred.

```{r socio, echo=F, eval=FALSE}
model1 = lmer(rating ~ (1|group:sender) + (1|group:receiver), 
              data = sociometric)
summary(model1, correlation = FALSE) 

model2 = lmer(rating ~ (1|group:sender) + (1|group:receiver) + (1|group), 
              data = sociometric)
summary(model2, correlation = F) 

model3 = lmer(rating ~ sexsend + sexrec + agesend + agerec + grsize + (1|group:sender) + (1|group:receiver) + (1|group), 
             data = sociometric)
summary(model3, correlation = FALSE)

model4 = lmer(
  rating ~ sexsend*sexrec + agesend + agerec + grsize +
    (1|group:sender) + (1|group:receiver) + (1|group), 
  data = sociometric)
summary(model4, correlation = FALSE)

c(AIC(model1), AIC(model2), AIC(model3), AIC(model4))
```

### Patents

Do a Poisson mixed effect model using the [patent data][Data]. Model the
number of citations (`ncit`) based on whether there was opposition
(`opposition`) and if it was for the biotechnology/pharmaceutical
industry (`biopharm`). Use year as a random effect to account for
unspecified economic conditions.

```{r patent_setup, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
patents0 = readr::read_tsv('data/raw_data/patent.raw')
patents = patents0 %>% 
  rename(opposition = opp) 
save(patents, file='data/patents.RData')
glmer(ncit ~ opposition +  biopharm + (1|year), data=patents, family='poisson')
```

```{r patent_starter, eval=FALSE}
load('data/patents.RData')
```

Interestingly, one can model overdispersion in a Poisson model by
specifying an random intercept for each observation (`subject` in the
data). In other words, no specific clustering or grouped structure is
necessary, but we can use the random effect approach to get at the extra
variance.
